# Civilized Boat Exit

Have you ever encountered a situation whereupon there is no other resolution than tactically retreating?

Has perchance this ignoble situation occurred to you when using an aquatic mode of transportation?

When looking back upon such moments, does your monacle quiver in shame at the pedestrian act of *jumping* of your transport?

Worry not furthermore!

I present thee the Civilized Boat Exit!

You can now proceed to exit your transport in an orderly manner, unlikely the rapscalions fleeing for their lives. For remember: **Manners maketh man.**

## Actual useful info

### Usage

If the player y coordinate is plus or minus 1 unit from the ladder exit point y coordinate (necessary since it is slightly above boat floor) the player will be transported to:
Negative ** Vector3(1f, 2f, 0f) ** of the exit point.

This means the Ladder component can be used in a separate mod, and this mod can handle ensuring the player can go up and down it.

### Install

Place plugin in BepInEx\plugins directory

### TODO

Make exit point configurable so that it has higher value to other mods.
